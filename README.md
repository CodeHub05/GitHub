# GitHub- PHP project


This is a sample project on PHP coding and github management. 
The project is based on a car wash website as a dynamic website. 
The name of the website is given as quality car wash for now. 
The aim is to create a fully functional website based on the car wash functionalities for now
which helps to utilise the open source facility and the github repository for learning. 
Anyone interested to join and improve the codes are welcome.
Can contribute as they wish from coding to documentation.  
Validating, testing, debugging and documentation are our current issues.
There are no issues posted yet but can email directly to the repository owner.
